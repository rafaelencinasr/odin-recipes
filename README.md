Welcome to my first project done while learning to code with help of The Odin Project.

The goal of this project is to make use of all the tools learned throughout the HTML Foundations section. It will also require the implementation of Git and GitHub repositories, the use of the Linux Command Line, best practices for commit messages, etc.

By the end of this project, the following elements of HTML will be used:

HTML Boilerplate
Headings
Paragraphs
Lists (ordered and unordered)
Embedding images
Relatives links
Throughout the development of the project, Git and GitHub will be used to store snapshots of its different production stages, hopefully with well written commit messages using VSCode.
